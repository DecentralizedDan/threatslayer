Our security browser extension uses advanced AI threat detection and a collaborative network of cyber rebels to block dangerous websites and protect you from phishing attacks, scams and bad downloads.\n \nPlus, our blockchain-enabled version, rewards you for helping the community fight back. (coming soon)\n\nFeatures\n\n* Instant protection from browser-based threats: dangerous websites, phishing attacks and bad downloads\n\n* A.I. Threat Detection detects novel urls and dangerous sites in real-time\n\n* Rewards you for making the community safer\n\nAbout our A.I. Threat Detection\n\nThreatSlayer uses A.I. Threat Detection to protect you from harmful websites. It works by comparing a list of trusted and untrusted websites to a trained system called a classifier. This classifier uses supervised learning to understand the differences between safe and dangerous sites, and can accurately identify potential threats, in real time, to keep you safe online. \n\nMost security products use static databases, so they're unable to detect attacks in real time. ThreatSlayer is one step ahead of the cyber criminals.\n\nWhat Data Does ThreatSlayer Collect?\n\nThreatSlayer collects no personal information. The only data it sends is a URL, which we then scan with our threat detecting AI. ThreatSlayer saves anonymized URLs that cannot be associated with any individual user.",
